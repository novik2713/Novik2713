Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a seasoned team manager and project leader hailing from Ukraine, boasting over 9 years of professional expertise in cultural project management and marketing. In February 2024 I finished a Code Academy Berlin Bootcamp and currently I am on an exciting journey, delving into the realms of Data Analysis and Machine Learning through a comprehensive Bootcamp.

My aspirations have led me to seek a new adventure in the IT sector, specifically in roles related to change management, business process analysis, data analytics, and project management. I bring to the table a unique blend of design thinking, user-centric approaches, analytical prowess, and an unwavering commitment to excellence.

As I embark on this career transition, my strengths lie in efficiently navigating the intersections of technology and business. Passionate about driving digital transformation, I aim to make a substantial impact on the digitalization strategy and business process optimization within an innovative and dynamic environment.

Join me in a conversation about diverse topics such as customer classification, data cleaning, marketing strategies, visual arts, theater, migration, and the culinary world. To explore more facets of my professional journey, feel free to connect with me on my LinkedIn account.
